## 🧩 Selected Projects  

### 🎥 Automated Media Artwork Generation  
Combined **heuristics + LLMs** to generate artwork and thumbnails for large media catalogs.  
→ Now in **alpha** with pilot customers, replacing manual selection with scalable automation.  

### 🗞️ Real-Time Content Agent  
Developed an **agentic framework using LangGraph** to create live news snippets and semantic chapters from 10+ concurrent streams.  
→ Enabled **real-time content packaging** with modular agents.  

### 🎧 Multimodal Ad-Break Precision  
Built and deployed a **multimodal (audio-video-text)** model using OpenL3 and text embeddings.  
→ Improved ad-break precision by **30%** after A/B testing in production.
