## 🧠 About Me  
I’m a **mathematician-turned-data scientist** passionate about applying rigorous thinking to real-world systems.  
At [Amagi Media Labs](https://www.amagi.com), I build production-grade ML pipelines that power intelligent media workflows — from real-time video understanding to content automation.  

- 🎓 **M.Sc. Mathematics**, IIT Ropar — Institute Medal for highest CGPA  
- 🎓 **B.Sc. Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics**, Christ University — Merit Scholar  
- 💡 Passionate about **multimodal learning**, **LLMs**, **agentic frameworks**, and **AI for media**  
- 🧩 I enjoy solving problems that demand **logic**, **structure**, and **creativity**

## 🧩 Selected Projects  

### 🎶 [Google Summer of Code: Konnakol for TidalCycles](https://github.com/tidalcycles/konnakol-gsoc)
Developed a **Haskell-based system** to formalize and generate *Konnakol* (South Indian rhythmic syllables) compositions.  
- Implemented pattern generation, validation (for rhythmic correctness and musicality), and visualization.  
- Integrated with **TidalCycles** for real-time audio performance and live demos.  
- Enabled unrestricted cycle and complexity support, opening new possibilities for computational rhythm generation.

### 🧮 [Zero to Hero – Neural Networks from Scratch](https://github.com/aravind-mohandas/karpathy-zero-to-hero)
A from-scratch reimplementation and extension of Andrej Karpathy’s *Zero to Hero* series.  
- Built foundational ML components — Linear layers, BatchNorm, backpropagation, and optimizers — without external frameworks.  
- Experimented with training simple networks on toy datasets to understand deep learning internals.  
- Currently extending to attention-based architectures for a deeper exploration of LLM fundamentals.
